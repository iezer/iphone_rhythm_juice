Rhythm Juice for the iPhone

Rhythm Juice delivers top-quality instructional dance videos for swing dancing, tap, and other styles, 
as well as personal coaching and feedback from the instructors.

This iPhone app is a prototype of an iPhone interface for Rhythm Juice to go along with the main site written in PHP Joomla, 
with the following features:

   * Downloading videos for offline viewing
   * Organize videos into different lessons, playlists, and lesson plans
   * track viewing statistics for each video, this is essential to compensating instructions and content creators.
   * Disabling viewing if a user's subscription has changed or expired.
   
The Rhythm Juice business model has gone through several iterations and eventually it was decided that an iPhone app built 
on this design was not required. The current model can be seen at www.rhythmjuice.com
